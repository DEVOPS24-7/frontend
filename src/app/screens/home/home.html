    <h1>Why DevOps Aspirants <span class="highlight">Fail Interviews</span></h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Over time, I’ve interacted with many DevOps aspirants, and I noticed a common pattern in why they fail to clear
      interviews.
      It’s rarely because of lack of intelligence — it’s usually due to gaps in practical exposure and real-world
      understanding.

            <h3>Lack of Real-Time Experience</h3>
            <p>Many learn tools theoretically —Jenkins, Kubernetes, AWS — but never work on a realistic project where
              these tools interact in a production-like environment.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="carousel-item">
            <h3>Lack of Repetitive Hands-on Practice</h3>
            <p>Doing something once is not enough. DevOps requires muscle memory — setting up pipelines, fixing issues,
              deploying apps, configuring infra repeatedly until it becomes second nature.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="carousel-item">
            <h3>No Exposure to End-to-End Production Flow</h3>
            <p>Most learners only practice individual tools, But interviews test your understanding of the full
              lifecycle: <br> Code → Build → Test → Artifact → Deploy → Monitor → Scale → Secure</p>
          </div>
          <div class="carousel-item">
            <h3>No Practical Understanding at Concepts level</h3>
            <p>People study definitions, but DevOps interviews focus on: <br> Conceptual knowledge alone won’t help —
              practical exposure at concept level is key.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="carousel-item">
            <h3>Documentation Discipline</h3>
            <p>Experienced DevOps engineers learn from real problems they solved. Aspirants often don't have the real
              problems to document. The documentation becomes your experience repository, extremely valuable in
              interviews.</p>
